Comment stuff out.  Use \\\ to comment out a line (takes a count), \\ to comment out the target of a motion (for example, \\ap to comment out a paragraph), and \\ in visual mode to comment out the selection.  That's it.

Install repeat.vim, vimscript #2136, to enable repeating with . the line commenting map \\\.

I wrote this because 5 years after Vim added support for mapping an operator, I still couldn't find a commenting plugin that leveraged that feature (I overlooked vimscript #1173).  Striving for minimalism, the first version weighs in at just 35 lines of code.

Oh, and it uncomments, too.
